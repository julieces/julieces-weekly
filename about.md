Hello! I am a senior at NYU studying computer science and I am excited to get my hands dirty in open source development! I am the Secretary and Programming Chair for NYU's CAS Student Council as well as the PR Lead for NYU's All University Events Committee. In my spare time, I love to ski with my friends and family and spend as much time near/on/in the ocean as I can.
